# Neural_Net_Image_Classification

https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs440/fa2022/MPs/mp5/assignment5.html

The goal of this project is to employ neural networks, nonlinear and multi-layer extensions of the linear perceptron, to classify images into four categories: ship, automobile, dog, or frog. That is, our ultimate goal is to create a classifier that can tell what each picture depicts.

In the code package, we see these files:

- reader.py - This file is responsible for reading in the data set. It creates a giant NumPy array of feature vectors corresponding to each image.
- mp5.py - This is the main file that starts the program, and computes the accuracy, and confusion matrix using the neural net implementation.
- neuralnet_part1.py and neuralnet_part2.py These are the files which contains the neural net code.
